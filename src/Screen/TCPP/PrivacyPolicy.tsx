      <br />
      <b>Information Sharing</b>
      <br />
      We may share your personal information with our affiliates, partners, and
      service providers to provide you with the services and features offered

      We take reasonable measures to protect the personal information we collect
      from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or destruction. However, please
      be aware that no method of transmitting or storing data is completely
      secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
